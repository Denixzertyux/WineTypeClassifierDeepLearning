# Wine Type Classifier üç∑

A simple deep learning project that builds a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify wine as either red or white. The model is trained on the popular Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This script demonstrates a complete, albeit simple, machine learning workflow:
* Fetching and loading data
* Preprocessing and combining datasets
* Visualizing data with Matplotlib
* Building, compiling, and training a neural network
* Making predictions on new data

## About The Project

This project predicts whether a wine is red or white by analyzing 11 of its chemical properties (e.g., `fixed acidity`, `citric acid`, `alcohol`, etc.). It uses a feedforward neural network (also known as a multi-layer perceptron) to perform this binary classification task.

The script automatically downloads the necessary data, trains the model, and then outputs its predictions for a sample of the test data.

### Built With

This project relies on the following major libraries:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
